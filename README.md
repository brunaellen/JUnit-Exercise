# PROJECT DEVELOPED DURING THE (TDD AND JAVA: AUTOMATED TESTS WITH JUNIT COURSE)

## I have to develop this project to learn and put in practice the TDD concept using JUnit.

* Understand the importance of writing automated tests in an application.
* Learn how to write automated tests with JUnit.
* Learn to use the TDD process when writing automated tests.
* Learn about JUnit's main annotations and features.

## About The Project
(The main focus of this application is to practice the creation of automated tests).
The application calculates a bonus and a salary adjustment to a given employee.

### Business logic
#### Bonus:
* A bonus of 10% is given to an employee that has a salary less than or equals to ten thousand(10000.00).
* An Employee won't receive a bonus if the salary is greater than ten thousand(10000.00).

#### salary adjustment:
* An employee will receive an adjustment of 3% per cent of his/her salary if his/her work performance was evaluated to UNSATISFACTORY.
* An employee will receive an adjustment of 15% per cent of his/her salary if his/her work performance was evaluated to EFFECTIVE.
* An employee will receive an adjustment of 20% per cent of his/her salary if his/her work performance was evaluated to EXCEPTIONAL.
